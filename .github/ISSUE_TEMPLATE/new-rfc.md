<!-- 
Most work does not need an RFC and can be encapsulated as an epic. RFCs are vehicles for major changes that fundamentally change Venn.

Before starting, please do the following:

1. Set the issue type to RFC
2. Assign any other contributors

RFCs are a way to propose significant changes to Venn. This can be anything from how local development works to a foundational change to how we store data. The more detailed your RFC is (including proof of concepts you may have done), the more support it may have.

Remember, billing is a space that requires stability. Companies cannot afford, literally, to have their billing system breaks. Be mindful of this when you propose an RFC. The core team has the right to reject or approve the RFC. @bryanmikaelian also has the right to have the final say if no consensus can be made.

This section should be used to describe the impact of not doing this change 

Things you should focus on:

1. What are the risks of doing this?
2. How would things continue to behave if we didn't implement this change?
3. What are the risks to Venn's stability if we didn't do this change?
