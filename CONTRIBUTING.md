# Contributing to Venn

Right now, Venn is barely in alpha development. Most of the ideas are still in our head and we still don't have a clear picture on everything. If you are intersted in following a long, please star the repo. As this project grows, we will open up contributions more.

## Private vs Public Repos

Venn is currently open source and plans to stay open source. The public repo (i.e. this one) is where we plan to do all bug fixes, security updates, releases and documentation. We do not plan to restrict PRs to this repo.

However, there is also a private repo where the majority of development work happens. Some of this work can be POC-related or just overall noise that the greater community doesn't need to see junking up their timelines. Any core feature work will also happen in the private repo but visiblity of that feature work will be made public through things like project boards and the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/vennbilling/projects/2/views/2). 

Contributor access to the private repo is available via sponsorship. Again, keep in mind we are in the early stages. Any support is welcomed but we aren't looking to scam folks or grift for money.

## Which repo do I contribute to?

### Bug fixes, performance improvements, documentation, feature proposals

This should be done to the public repo via PRs. We welcome feature proposals but, keep in mind, the billing space is built on the tenant stability (hence why we picked Clojure!) and we reserve the right to reject any feature proposal that might be too risky.

### Core Features on the Roadmap, Architecture changes, Breaking Changes

These types of changes will only be allowed to the private repo. If you open a PR to the pulic repo with these kinds of changes, we will request they be made to the private repo. We're happy to carry your changes overs and get you limited access to the private repo. We want to recognize your hardwork and deciding to be or not be a sponsor shouldn't resetrict that.
